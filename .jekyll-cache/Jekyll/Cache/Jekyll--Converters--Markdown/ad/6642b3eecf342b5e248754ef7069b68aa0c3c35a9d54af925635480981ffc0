<p>NPL(Neural Parallel Language) is a new programming language. It was started as my exploration of coding logics in a networked environment.  <br />
Throughout the years, I have written over a million lines of code with it. All my other projects since 2005 is written in it.</p>

</ul>

<p>Paracraft is a standalone 3d animation software for everyone. 
It was my exploration of CAD(computer aided design) using the vision brain (i.e. your right brain).
Paracraft is an extensible tool that everyone can learn to create videos and computer programs.
I am using it to promote NPL language in self learning college to teach students programming.</p>

<p>Magic Haqi is a free/paid 3D MMORPG published by taomee in November, 2009, allowing kids to play, create and share 3d worlds. It has over 5 million registered users and tens of thousands of user created works in China. The software is developed and owned by the developers of Paracraft, but has nothing to do with Paracraft. The initial version of paracraft was developed as a module in Magic Haqi. We have valid contract with its publisher taomee for their use of paracraft and its source code.</p>
